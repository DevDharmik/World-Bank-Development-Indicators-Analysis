# 🌍 World Bank Development Indicators Analysis (1960–2022)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **global economic, social, environmental, and governance trends** using the **World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)** dataset covering the period **1960–2022**. The objective is to explore how countries and regions have evolved over time and to examine relationships between key development indicators across multiple dimensions.

Using **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **data visualization techniques**, the project investigates **15 analytical questions**, each supported by a dedicated visualization. The analysis highlights long-term trends, cross-country comparisons, and meaningful correlations related to development outcomes worldwide.

The analysis is implemented in **Python** using **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** within a **Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)** environment. Additionally, an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** is developed and deployed via **GitHub and Streamlit Community Cloud**, enabling users to explore selected visualizations dynamically.
