🌍 World Bank Development Indicators Analysis (1960–2022)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global economic, social, environmental, and governance trends using the World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset covering the period 1960–2022. The objective is to explore how countries and regions have evolved over time and to examine relationships between key development indicators across multiple dimensions.

Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques, the project investigates 15 analytical questions, each supported by a dedicated visualization. The analysis highlights long-term trends, cross-country comparisons, and meaningful correlations related to development outcomes worldwide.

The analysis is implemented in Python using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn within a Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab) environment. Additionally, an interactive Streamlit dashboard is developed and deployed via GitHub and Streamlit Community Cloud, enabling users to explore selected visualizations dynamically.
