This project analyzes global economic, social, environmental, and governance trends using the World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset covering the period 1960–2022. The objective is to explore how countries and regions have evolved over time and how key development indicators relate to one another.

Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques, the project investigates 15 analytical questions spanning multiple dimensions of development, including economic growth, health outcomes, education, climate impact, governance, technology adoption, and innovation. Each question is supported by a dedicated visualization designed to reveal long-term trends, cross-country comparisons, and meaningful correlations.

The analysis is implemented in Python using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn within a Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab) environment. In addition, an interactive Streamlit dashboard is developed and deployed via GitHub and Streamlit Community Cloud, allowing users to explore a subset of the visualizations dynamically.

This project demonstrates practical skills in:

Real-world data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Time-series and comparative visualization

Insight-driven storytelling with data

Building and deploying interactive dashboards
